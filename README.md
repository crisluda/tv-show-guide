 # Car Show Guide
A front-end React application for viewing car tv shows and their details. The data for the shows were obtained from [TV Maze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) using the fetch API and stored in the Redux store to be accessed by multiple components. There is also a filter feature for filtering car shows.
This project was set up with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
